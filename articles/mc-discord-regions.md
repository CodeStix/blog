# Version 2.x (in development)

This **will be** a released bot that everyone can easily use, with a great 'out of the box' experience. You just have to install the bukkit plugin, and create a Discord category and you're set.

# Version 1.x (available)

This is the standalone version of Discord Regions, every Minecraft server that wants to use this plugin needs to register a Discord bot. This is the right version for you if...

-   You want to host the bot yourself
-   Advanced control
-   Faster Discord API calls (small difference, there is no 'man in the middle')

But, if you don't want to take the time to set all of this up, you can use the centralized version of this plugin (version 2.x, still in development), which is easy to setup, but has less advanced features.
