## Usage :computer:

The bot uses the `r/` prefix:

-   `r/pics`: shows a top post from the r/pics subreddit.
-   `r/pics new`: shows a new post. You can also use **top**, **best**, **rising** and **hot**.
-   `r/pics top`: shows a top post.
-   `r/pics week` or `r/pics top week`: shows a top post from the last week. You can also use **hour**, **day**, **month**, **year** and **all**.

:information_source: **Protip:** You can use the `r//` shortcut to repeat your previous input.

**:warning: To enable NSFW reddit content (e.g. r/fiftyfifty), you MUST mark the Discord channel as NSFW.**
